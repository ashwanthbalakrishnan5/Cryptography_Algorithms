# Cryptography Algorithms

This repository contains Pure Python3 implementations of various cryptographic algorithms. Feel free to explore and use them in your projects.

## Algorithms Included

1. **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
    - A symmetric-key block cipher used for data encryption.
    - Implementation: `des.py`

2. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
    - A widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm.
    - Implementation: `aes.py`

3. **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**
    - An asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure communication.
    - Implementation: `rsa.py`

4. **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**
    - A widely used hash function for generating fixed-size hash values.
    - Implementation: `md5.py`

5. **MITM_DH (Man-in-the-Middle Diffie-Hellman)**
    - A demonstration of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.
    - Implementation: `mitm_dh.py`

6. **SHA-512 (Secure Hash Algorithm 512)**
    - A cryptographic hash function producing a 512-bit hash value.
    - Implementation: `sha512.py`

7. **DSS (Digital Signature Standard)**
    - A standard for digital signatures based on the use of public-key cryptography.
    - Implementation: `dss.py`

8. **SSL**
    - A Simple Client Server implementation of SSL.
    - Implementation: `server.py`
